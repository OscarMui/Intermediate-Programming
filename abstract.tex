\chapter*{Preface}

This piece of notes covers some topics in the \href{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}{Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI) syllabus} \footnote{Link: \href{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}} that I found the most useful. Aiming to introduce senior secondary school students with more advanced programming theories, so as to prepare them for programming competitions like HKOI. It also serves as a good revision material for DSE ICT coding module (however not everything in the DSE syllabus is covered).

It is a very simplified piece of notes with a huge number of links to other resources, as the internet is a better teacher than me, yet I am here to provide you with information that I found the most useful when I was in your position a few years ago.

\section*{A word of warning}

This piece of notes aims to include everything in the shortest amount of time possible, so explanations and examples may be inadequate. Unfortunately, a small amount of sections of the notes are incomplete due to a lack of time, you should be able to fill in the gaps on your own by asking Google.

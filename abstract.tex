\chapter*{Preface}

This piece of notes covers some topics in the \href{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}{Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI) syllabus} \footnote{Link: \href{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}{https://hkoi.org/en/competition-syllabus/}} that I found the most useful. Aiming to introduce senior secondary school students with more advanced programming theories, so as to prepare them for programming competitions like HKOI. It also serves as a good revision material for DSE ICT coding module (however not everything in the DSE syllabus is covered).


It is a very simplified piece of notes with a huge number of links to other resources, as the internet is a better teacher than me, yet I am here to provide you with information that I found the most useful when I was in your position a few years ago.

\section*{About me}

I am a second-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. I joined the senior group HKOI before in the year 2021-2022 and obtained a silver award at the finals. 

\section*{A word of warning}

As you see in the title, this is just a draft, aiming to include everything in the shortest amount of time possible, so explanations and examples may be inadequate. If there are any errors in the notes feel free to contact me by email oscar.mui@univ.ox.ac.uk
